Government forms can be confusing and convoluted. We aim to provide underserved populations with an accurate and quick way to translate, understand, and fill necessary forms such as immigration papers, welfare applications, passport applications, and tax returns.

This platform will deploy using the Wix Code platform and use Google Cloud Vision to perform OCR on images that users upload.
